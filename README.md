# Tippy

I am excited to share my very first Android project — a simple yet practical tip calculator app. Guided by a tutorial on [Freecodecamp's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjrKMcnKahY), this app is designed to help users effortlessly calculate tips and totals after entering a base amount and a tip percentage. Beyond following the tutorial, I introduced enhancements to improve the user experience, making the app even more user-friendly. Through this project, I aim to solidify my understanding of Android fundamentals while creating a useful tool that can be used in everyday situations.

## Improvements

I started by following the tutorial and completed the original version of the app, which is both functional and easy to use. However, I saw the potential for further enhancement to make the app more intuitive and better. After carefully analyzing the original design, I implemented several improvements to enhance the app’s usability and overall aesthetic.

1. Currency Symbol for Amount:
    * Original: The base amount input field did not display a currency symbol, making it less clear that the value represents money.
    * Improved: Added a currency symbol next to the base amount input to clarify that it’s a monetary value.

2. Service Quality Selector:
    * Original: No direct way to specify the quality of service, which could affect the tip percentage.
    * Improved: Introduced a "Service" section with three options: "Poor," "Good," and "Awesome," allowing users to quickly select the quality of service and automatically adjust the tip percentage.

3. Increasing the Font Size:
    * Original: The font size for numeric values was the same as for other text elements, making them less prominent.
    * Improved: Used a larger font size for the main numeric values (Base, Tip, Total), making these figures more prominent and easier to read.

4. Bold the Font:
    * Original: The font-weight for numeric values was the same as for other text elements, leading to a lack of emphasis on key information.
    * Improved: Made important numeric values bold to ensure they stand out, drawing users' attention to these critical figures.

5. Layout and Spacing:
    * Original: The layout was basic, with no additional spacing or grouping of related elements.
    * Improved: Adjusted the layout to group related elements (e.g., service selection and tip calculation) together, providing a more organized and visually pleasing interface.

## Potential Improvements

1. **App Icon**: Introduce a custom app icon to provide a quick and efficient visual cue, enhancing the app's identity and user recognition.
2. **Customizable Tip Percentages**: Add a settings option that allows users to customize the tip percentages for different service levels (e.g., adjusting the "GOOD" service button to 18%).
3. **Round-Up Option**: Include an option for users to round up the total amount to the nearest whole number, making payments more straightforward.
4. **Bill Splitting**: Implement a feature that allows users to split the bill among multiple people, simplifying group payments.
5. **Dark Mode**: Offer a dark mode option for users who prefer a darker interface, improving accessibility and user comfort in low-light conditions.
6. **Dynamic Animations**: Add animation effects when updating values to create a more engaging and dynamic user experience.
7. **Optimized Layout Management**: As new features are added, consider utilizing advanced layout management techniques to maintain a clean and organized user interface.

## Conclusion

Starting with a basic, functional version from a Freecodecamp tutorial, I built my first Android app, Tippy. Although I implemented several improvements, there are still numerous opportunities to further refine and expand the app's functionality. This project has allowed me to deepen my understanding of Android development, from fundamental concepts to the finer details of UI/UX design. I am eager to continue learning and applying these skills to create even more sophisticated and user-friendly applications in the future.
